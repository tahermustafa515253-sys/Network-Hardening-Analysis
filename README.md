# Network-Hardening-Analysis
Network hardening methods to prevent future breaches after an attack.

## Overview
This project was part of a Coursera activity from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.  
The scenario involved a social media organization that suffered a major data breach exposing customer information. The task was to identify vulnerabilities and recommend network hardening methods to prevent future attacks.

## Tools and Methods
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA):** Adds a second verification factor to secure accounts.  
- **Firewall Maintenance:** Establishes and maintains rules to filter network traffic.  
- **Password Policies:** Enforces strong, unique passwords and prevents sharing among employees.

## Outcome
Applying these methods enhances authentication security, strengthens network protection, and minimizes the risk of recurring breaches.
