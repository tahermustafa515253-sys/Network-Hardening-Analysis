# Network-Hardening-Analysis
Network hardening methods to prevent future breaches after an attack.

## Overview
This project analyzes a data breach at a social media organization and identifies key vulnerabilities that led to the incident. The goal was to recommend effective network hardening methods to prevent future breaches.

## Tools and Methods
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra verification layer to prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Firewall Maintenance:** Establishes inbound and outbound rules to block malicious traffic.  
- **Password Policies:** Enforces strong, unique passwords and prohibits password sharing.

## Outcome
Implementing these measures strengthens authentication, improves network defense, and reduces the risk of future data breaches.
